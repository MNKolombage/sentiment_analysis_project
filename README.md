# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews

This project is a simple but practical implementation of **Sentiment Analysis** using machine learning. It classifies customer reviews as either **Positive** or **Negative**, based on text data. The model was trained on labeled data and deployed as a web application using **Microsoft Azure**.

## ✨ Features

- Preprocessing of textual data (stop word removal, tokenization, etc.)
- Train/Test split and model evaluation
- Logistic Regression classifier
- Real-time sentiment prediction through a web interface
- Deployed to Azure (with working demo video)

## 🧪 Dataset

A labeled dataset of customer reviews with sentiment tags was used for training and testing.  
Example:
  Review: "This product is amazing!"
  Label: Positive
